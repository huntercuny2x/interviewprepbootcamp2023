### Repo Structure

- This README contains the schedule for the course 
- The `assignments` folder is where you will put your classwork and homeworks (other than p2p questions). This is also where we will post
  solutions after the classwork/homework should have already been done.

### Getting started 

To get setup to submit classwork/homework, **fork this repository**.

Then do the following when you do classwork:

- Create a file for each problem you are working on and put it in the appropriate folder.

### What if the problem is too hard?

If you are not able to solve the problem at home then post up a
program containing the following:

As comments:

- a description of the approach(es) you thought of
- a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For
  example:
    - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
      of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
      it?
    - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
      were you unable to implement, and why?

As code:

- whatever part of a program you wrote if you wrote one

We prefer you submit something that runs, but sometimes we don't get
that far. Whether it runs or not, just submit what you have.
